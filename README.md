Prompts-storage for ingesting to our chatbot. Inspired by: https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts

You can convert the csv file to json using the `csv2json.py` script.

The prompts are stored in the `prompts.json` file, which is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a prompt, and has the following fields:
- `act`: The action of the prompt.
- `prompt`: The prompt itself.
